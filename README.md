 ## Group Assignments 1 - 3 
 ### _@ the Developer Academy - OCT 2022_

## Assignments Include:

- Dice Rolling Simulator
    - This developed into a funtioning blackjack game with one player against the dealer. 
    - There is a "card deck" simulating the point values of all the cards in a deck
    - If an ace is selected then you will get a prompt to choose a 1 or 11, the choice for the dealer is figured into the logic
    - Some further improvements would be to allow you to "split the deck" when you get identical cards and then bring in multiplayer   

- Guess the number game
- Madlibs Generator
